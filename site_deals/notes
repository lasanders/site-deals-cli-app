1. Plan my Gem - imagine interface:
  -create an interface to look for shopping deals on Gilt and Ruelala
  -user will type site-deals
  -different brands will be listed
  -ask user to select brand if they'd like to see more
2. Start with project structure
  -bundle gem site-deals - used Bundler to generate
  -create lib, bin, rake, README, gemspec
3. Start with entry point - run site-deals - create site_deals in bin folder.
4. Force that to build CLI interface
-defined execution point - the file where people will run program (./bin/site_deals).
-try to get it working in terminal ("hello world"). Yay! it worked.
5. Stub out Interface
  -create class SiteDeals::CLI
  -In bin/site_deals, link to lib/site_deals/cli and lib/site_deals/version.
  -This creates a new instance of controller cli. set the call method, which starts list_deals, menu, goodbye
6. Start making things real - we need brand name, url, items, price availability
