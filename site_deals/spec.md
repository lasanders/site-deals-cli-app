Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:

  "X"    Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - I created a CLI that is responsible for listing the deals, and asking the user for input, and giving more information based on that input.
  "X"  Pull data from an external source - In my deals.rb folder, I created methods to scrape the external websites for brands, items, prices, and costs.
  "X"   Implement both list and detail views - I implemented a list view and gave more information for accessing actual clothing site.
